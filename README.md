# Human Computer Interaction Course Homework

Welcome to the Human Computer Interaction Course Homeworks repository! This collection of projects represents my studies in the Human Computer Interaction course, which I undertook during the Fall of 2024 at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) under the instruction of Dr. [Mohammad Hassan Shirali-Shahreza](https://shahreza.shirali.ir/).
